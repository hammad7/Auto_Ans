As i am working in Engineering industry it has come to know that the Enginering candidate has more value than others and the progress speed is alos high than others. So my mind has converted into technical line and i would like to go in for part time technical diploma in mechanical engineering because Financially I am not strong. I am very much interested in computer software courses but that require more fund to complete it. so as to considering all the present aspects i would like goin for engineering couses and additionally I have got good knowledge about the technical measures. Please suggest I am very much embarrased as i have already lossed my 3 yeatrs. Thank u Amit","course comp",direct,opinion,0
